## Sprint reveiw:
* Look more at specification. 
* Pretty good timing with project and workload, however, not enough presentation planning. 
* Should do more presentation preparation. 
* Overall good performance. 
* Code is scalable and readable, needs commenting though. 
* Task management for sprints is needed (difficulty distribution).
* Everything was completed on time.
* The project management format is good for nowadys circumstances.
